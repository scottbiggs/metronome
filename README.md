# Biggs' Metronome
After seeing all the surprisingly limited metronome apps out there, I was reminded of the old addage: if you want something done right, do it yourself.

First and foremost, this app will be free, contain no ads, and respect the user's privacy.  Of course, that's the way with all my apps.  Too bad others don't have this small level of honor.

### Implemented Features
Still designing, nothing implemented yet.

### Features Wish-List
- Set Beats-Per-Minute (bpm) from 1 to 1000.
- UI that works easily with one hand while not paying careful attention
- Light and Dark UI options
- Works for phones and tablets in all orientations
- Tap to set bpm
- Easily setup emphasis for measures with numerators ranging from 1 to 100
- plenty of crisp sounds to choose from (for both beat and empahsis)
- volume control that's separate from phone, and able to be much louder if necessary.
- Stay on, stay off (completely dark) depending on user's choice
- Programmable times: be able to go for 86 beats at 72 bpm then 8 measures at 48 bpm, then continue until stopped at 112 bpm, etc. etc. etc.
- Programmable measures: be able to specify certain number of measures at 4/4, then certain at 3/4, then some at 4/4, the some at 3/8, etc. etc. etc.
- Graphics: pendulum (tradition), bouncing ball, flashing, nothing, and perhaps some more
